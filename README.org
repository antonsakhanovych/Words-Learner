* Words Learner
Word translation game where the user is presented with words in one language and are asked to provide translation in another language. The application reads word pairs from a JSON file, presents a random word to the user, and asks for the translation.

* Prerequisites
- Cargo.
  I suggest installing [[https://rustup.rs/][rustup]] and installing stable branch of rust but you can also install plain [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html][cargo]]

* Quick Start
1.Clone this repo
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/antonsakhanovych/Words-Learner.git
#+end_src

2.Create your words.json file in the format:
#+begin_src json
[
    {
        "from": "Hello",
        "to": "Merhaba"
    },
    {
        "from": "How are you?",
        "to": "Nasılsın?"
    }
]
#+end_src

3.Compile
#+begin_src bash
cargo build --release
#+end_src

4.Start the game
#+begin_src bash
./target/release/words_learner
#+end_src

You will see output similar to this:
